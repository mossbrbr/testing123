# testing123
Testing github repo
For future directions on how to use GitHub

Created a branch off of Master called "test" using the command
brent@BrentPC:~/testing123$ git branch test


Next, from the CLI, I switched over to my newly created branch using
the command
brent@BrentPC:~/testing123$ git checkout test
Switched to branch 'test'
brent@BrentPC:~/testing123$ git branch
  master
* test
